# What?

J.A.R.V.I.S. is a community-driven python bot that aims to be as simple as possible to serve humans with their everyday tasks.

# Why?

I created JARVIS with two goals in mind:

1. It should have a lot of useful features \(both fun and commonly used\).
2. Anyone can contribute to this project. \(As this is module-based, anybody with a decent knowledge of Python can contribute.\) One of the prime goals of this project is to lower the entry barrier into the world of open source.
