# Meet The Vision

Vision is the evolution of Jarvis. It aims to write generic modules which can be exposed as standalone APIs as well as plugged into various platforms like Messenger, Slack, Discord, Telegram, Skype, etc.

For a quick overview of how AI is used in this project, see [https://vimeo.com/238717639](https://vimeo.com/238717639)

# What?

J.A.R.V.I.S. is a community-driven python bot that aims to be as simple as possible to serve humans with their everyday tasks.

# Why?

I created JARVIS with two goals in mind:

1. It should have a lot of useful features \(both fun and commonly used\).
2. Anyone can contribute to this project. \(As this is module-based, anybody with a decent knowledge of Python can contribute.\) One of the prime goals of this project is to lower the entry barrier into the world of open source.
