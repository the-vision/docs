# Meet The Vision

Vision is the evolution of [Jarvis](history.md). It aims to write generic modules which can be exposed as standalone APIs as well as plugged into various platforms like Messenger, Slack, Discord, Telegram, Skype, etc.

For a quick overview of how AI is used in this project, see [https://vimeo.com/238717639](https://vimeo.com/238717639)

# What?

J.A.R.V.I.S. is a community-driven python bot that aims to be as simple as possible to serve humans with their everyday tasks.

# Why?

I created JARVIS with two goals in mind:

1. It should have a lot of useful features \(both fun and commonly used\).
1. Anyone can contribute to this project. \(As this is module-based, anybody with a decent knowledge of Python can contribute.\) One of the prime goals of this project is to lower the entry barrier into the world of open source.

# Vision's Vision (see what I did there?)

1. Get [100 people](progress.md) started with open-source in 2019!
1. Build a community to scale this.
